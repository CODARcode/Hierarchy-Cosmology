\begin{abstract}
Many scientific data analysis problems require discovering latent/intrinsic
structure within the data, grouping the data into corresponding clusters, and
then performing operations on the respective groups. To address the curse of
dimensionality, we are developing hierarchical methods that exploit the nested
structure embedded in many natural phenomena and their mathematical
representations, such as those arising from spatial/temporal discretization,
network structure, and parameter space characteristics.   By exploiting these
hierarchies, we intend to develop a more scalable approach to a broad range of
analysis tasks.

A motivating example that we will target initially is the halo-center-finding
problem arising in computational cosmology. The goal is to find a particle
within a halo that provides the lowest potential, where the potential for a
given particle requires a global calculation over all particles (e.g.,
proportional to the sum of inverse interparticle distances). Given $n$
particles within a halo, the standard brute force algorithm will end up with
$O(n^2)$ complexity. A typical halo has 20 million particles and thus such a
global operation comes with considerable expense. Our approach is to design a
hierarchical clustering scheme. Instead of calculating correlations between
every pair of particles, we calculate the correlations of centers provided by
every pair of sub clusters that can at least reduce the computation cost to
$O(n\log{n})$. We will test our algorithm on benchmark datasets provided by the
HACC ECP application project. Our hypothesis is that in many cases, the
hierarchical algorithm will perform significantly better than its worst-case
complexity guarantee.

We will also benchmark the hierarchical approach on material science analysis
and compression problems encountered by the EXAALT application project. The
hierarchical nature of these algorithms means that we can often find surrogate
models with less complexity, and approximate solutions (by operating at the
coarsest levels of the hierarchy whenever possible) in far less time than
single-level traditional approaches. As such, we will perform a full tradeoff
study using emerging platforms to quantify the tradeoffs between accuracy and
performance on these test applications, and provide guidance on its suitability
for real-time online analysis.
